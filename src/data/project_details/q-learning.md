OpenAI Gym provides different environments and corresponding problems that can be solved using reinforcement 
learning (RL) techniques. Since I am absolutely fascinated by RL approach, where an agent tries to optimize 
its reward by random actions and learns which action at which state returns the maximum reward, 
I started to learn and experiment with RL and OpenAI gym. 

With the help of Q-Learning, the easiest methods of RL, I was able to solve the 
[Taxi](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Taxi-v3/), as well as the
[Frozen Lake](https://gym.openai.com/envs/FrozenLake-v0/) environment. 

The result of a trained agent on 100k episodes on the taxi environment can be seen below.
