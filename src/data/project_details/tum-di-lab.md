The TUM Data Innovation Lab is a semester long project in a small interdisciplinary team of students, with the goal to
solve a real world and data related problem from company partners. Together with four awesome students, I worked on the
project named: Geometrical Deep Learning on 3D Models: Classification for Additive Manufacturing, given by VW Data:Lab.

I really enjoyed working on this particular project, since it gave us the opportunity to solve really exciting problems,
applying different data science methods scientifically and learn from great Data Scientists and Project 
Managers from Data:Lab, from researches from TUM, as well as from each other.
