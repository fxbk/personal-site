# Intro

Solving mathematical problems, developing intelligent algorithms, and generating insights from a wide variety of data - that's just a brief outline of what I've been doing over the past few years and what I'm burning for. Here are a few more details:‚Ä®‚Ä®

üéì During my mathematics studies, I acquired the mathematical fundamentals of current technologies. In addition, I focus on building knowledge and skills in machine learning and data analytics.‚Ä®‚Ä®

üßë‚Äçüíª In addition to my studies, I have completed various own projects and internships in the fields of data science and software development. As a founder of ferblick., I developed and marketed an innovative method for the analysis of manual processes using computer vision. ‚Ä®‚Ä®

ü¶æ I am particularly passionate about machine learning, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning. There is nothing more exciting for me than watching how these algorithms can solve a wide variety of tasks better and better.
