Here are a few more details:\u2028\u2028\n\n\ud83c\udf93 During my mathematics studies, I acquired the mathematical fundamentals of current technologies. In addition, I focus on building knowledge and skills in machine learning and data analytics.\u2028\u2028\n\n\ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\udcbb In addition to my studies, I have completed various own projects and internships in the fields of data science and software development. As a founder of ferblick., I developed and marketed an innovative method for the analysis of manual processes using computer vision. \u2028\u2028\n\n\ud83e\uddbe I am particularly passionate about machine learning, especially deep learning and reinforcement learning. There is nothing more exciting for me than watching how these algorithms can solve a wide variety of tasks better and better.\n\n# I like\n\n- Going to the gym\n- Skydiving\n- Learning new things\n- Traveling\n- Skiing\n- Books\n- Podcasts ([Lex Fridman](https://lexfridman.com/podcast/), [WorkLife with Adam Grant](https://www.adamgrant.net/podcast/), [Deep Questions with Cal Newport](https://www.calnewport.com/podcast/), [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/category/podcast-episodes/)) \n\n\n# Travel / Geography\n\n- I am from originally from Stuttgart, Germany.
